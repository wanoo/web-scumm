// The story world without the compiler (4.1.15, after the CI run of PR #50): what a save needs to write a game played
// in its story world (`SaveEnvelopeV4`), and the shape a stored world is checked against, in the player's first chunk.
// The compiler (core/remix/compile.ts, apply.ts) is loaded only when a game is played in another world: the boot
// imports it for a game with a manifest, a link or a save of another world. `storyWorld` gives exactly what
// `storyVariant` gives (tests/remix-compile.test.ts compares them) without compiling the manifest.
