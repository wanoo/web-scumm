// The player's transport to a Reality Bridge (4.1.1, D17): Server-Sent Events read with fetch (so the capability
// travels in an Authorization header, never in a URL), and the same signals by a plain fetch by cursor when a stream
// is not possible. Acknowledgements are POSTs. A `WorldSignalPort`: the engine never sees the network.
//
// Three cursors (4.1.8, the P0 of the plan): `received` is the last sequence the Bridge sent, `delivered` the last one
// handed to the reader, `durable` the last one the reader acknowledged (applied and saved). Every request to the
// Bridge, a poll or a reconnection, asks from `durable`: a signal handed over and not acknowledged (a transient
// refusal, a save that failed, a crash before the ack) is delivered again, never skipped. 4.1.7 asked from the
// delivered cursor, so after signal 1 was handed over the connection asked `after=1` whether or not it was applied.
// In SSE mode the Bridge keeps the stream open: a signal not settled when the next one is read makes the port end the
// stream itself after a wait (doubling up to a minute) and reconnect from `durable`, which asks for it again.
