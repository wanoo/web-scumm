# Roadmap: from v1.3 to the 4.1.x line, and 4.2

*Started on 3 October 2026 from an external audit of v1.2.1 as "from a reactive engine to a world engine (v1.3 → v2.0)"; every release since has its section below, the newest last. French version: [docs/fr/ROADMAP.md](../fr/ROADMAP.md).*

## Context

An external audit of web-scumm concluded that the engine can produce a good short point-and-click, but not comfortably
a game of 30 to 100 rooms, because it was purely reactive (tap → rule → commands) with no world simulation. We checked its
18 claims against the code: 12 exact, 4 partial, 2 wrong (`give` / `take` / `room` are not commands; the minigames are
not in the core, they are already a registry a game extends from `games/<id>/index.ts`). The main diagnosis holds.

The goal: one person, with any AI, can make a **complete** (long) game with this engine. This roadmap orders the work by
what actually blocks a long game, not by fidelity to Day of the Tentacle.

What was true in v1.2.1 (`src/engine/core/types.ts`, `engine.ts`, `src/engine/tools/solve.ts`):
- one `hero`, one inventory; actors stored per `room.actor`, no command moved an actor to another room;
- no autonomous script, no timer, no event: `onEnter` was the only trigger besides a tap; the only loop was the render rAF;
- fixed 640 × 400, no camera; no prop animation, no frame event;
- talk topics `{topic, if, do}` per room, branching through `choice` / `if` inside `do`;
- exits = hotspots with `goto`; `validate` builds no room graph;
- one save (`<id>.save`), a different version means a new game, no migration;
- best-first solver, `--max 20000`, start from a checkpoint possible, no notion of goal or invariant;
- no `custom`, no locale, no `voice`, settings = music / sfx.

## Our take on the audit (kept, changed)

**Kept**: scheduler + events + world actors as the first milestone; no rewrite, no Phaser; chapter solver with goals and
invariants; multi-slot saves with data-only migrations; a "why is this rule unavailable" debugger; animations with frame
events; an escape hatch with effects declared to the solver.

**Changed**:
- *Events and the scheduler are one feature.* An event bus without scripts able to wait (`waitEvent`, `waitUntil`) is
  only a renamed flag. Both land together, in the same serialisable state format.
- *Several playable characters is not P0* for "anyone makes a complete game": it is P0 only for DOTT. It comes after the
  camera and after the saves, because it changes the shape of the state and should benefit from migrations.
- *No separate "dialogue graph".* Topics + `choice` + `do` are already a data graph; a second format would duplicate the
  DSL and break the solver, MCP and prompts. What is missing is the **visualisation** in the Studio (a tree derived from
  the topics) and filling known gaps (the Studio cannot add or remove a topic). Insult sword fighting is an *activity*
  (minigame), not a dialogue primitive.
- *Minigames → plugins*: already the case (`minigames` exported by the game, merged into `App`). Only docs and an example
  outside the core are missing; not a priority.
- *Localisation*: retrofit by extraction (texts identified by their path `room.hotspot.look`, `locales/<lang>.json`
  files that override) rather than keys in the content, so the DSL the AI writes stays light. Stays P2.
- *The real risk* is not technical: every added primitive must be understood by `validate`, `solve`, CONTENT_GUIDE en/fr,
  the prompts generator, the MCP tools and the Studio, otherwise the AI will not use it, or badly. Every milestone below
  includes that propagation, and the demo uses every primitive at least once.

## Design principles (every milestone)

1. **Everything stays data**: new commands in the `Cmd` union, new typed fields on `RoomDef` / `GameDef`, never
   functions in the content (except the `custom` registry, which lives in `index.ts` like the minigames).
2. **Everything is in `GameState`**: script program counters, world actors, camera ⇒ exact save and resume,
   deterministic solver.
3. **The solver models time as a choice**: "let script X finish its iteration" is a solver action, `wait` is zero in
   simulation; the effects of a `custom` command are declared (`effects: Cmd[]`).
4. **One milestone = at most one `saveVersion` bump**, with a migration provided.
5. **The private game follows**: its repository embeds a copy of `src/engine`; at every milestone the engine is copied
   back and the game replayed (e2e, tests, solver). That is the full-size regression test.

## Milestones

### M1 — "World" (v1.3, shipped): the world acts without a tap

- **World actors**: `GameState.where` (character → room), `CharacterDef.room` (starting room), `{ moveActor: [char, room], at? }`,
  condition `{ actorIn: [char, room] }`; a moving character only shows in the room it is in; checkpoints take `where`.
  No save bump: per-room actor overrides (`room.actor`) are unchanged, `where` is filled from the characters' `room`.
- **Events**: `{ emit: id }`; `RoomDef.events` and `GameDef.events`: `{ on, if?, once?, do }`, run synchronously, room
  then game. An event is not a state: it fires, then is gone; a listener sets a flag when something must be remembered.
- **Scheduler**: `RoomDef.scripts` / `GameDef.scripts`: `{ id, while?, loop?, do }`; commands `waitUntil`, `waitEvent`,
  `startScript`, `stopScript`; `GameState.scripts[id] = { pc, done?, off? }` so a save resumes them. Scripts advance one
  command at a time between the player's actions, never during one, a cutscene, a conversation or a minigame.
  `Engine.autoScripts` (true in the browser, false in node: tests and the solver call `runScript` / `advance`).
- **Solver**: "Script <id>" is an action (run until it waits, ends or loops); numeric flags are clamped to the highest
  threshold a condition compares them with, so a counter script does not create states forever. **Validator**: unique
  script ids, loops that never wait, events emitted but never listened to (and the reverse), moving characters without a
  starting room or without an actor in the target room.
- **Dev panel**: World (room of each moving character, editable) and Scripts (position, stop / restart). **Studio**: Scripts
  and Events sections of a room. **e2e**: a "Script <id>" step waits for the script to move on.
- **Demo**: Biscuit stretches on his own (house script), Lou strolls along the stalls (market script, `while`), the market
  emits `key_found`, the game listener moves Grandpa (and his armchair) home for the finale (`moveActor`, `actorIn`).
- Also: navmesh paths are pulled straight when the shortcut stays inside the walk zone (the hero no longer takes a detour
  around a corner it does not need).

### M2 — "Scale" (v1.4, shipped): hold 40 rooms without losing the testers

Files: `src/engine/tools/{validate,solve}.ts`, new `src/engine/tools/graph.ts`, `src/engine/dom/app.ts` (menu), new
`src/engine/core/migrate.ts`, a `world` review page.

- **Declared exits**: `RoomDef.exits: Record<id, { to; entry?; if?; walkTo?; transition?: 'fade' | 'cut' }>`. An exit is
  rendered as a hotspot (same layout); the engine generates the `goto` rule. Existing `goto` hotspots stay valid.
- **World graph**: `graph.ts` builds rooms / exits / entries; `validate` reports unreachable rooms, missing entry points,
  unintended one-way exits (unless `oneWay: true`). `npm run page:world`: a clickable graph (DOT / SVG export), also in
  the Studio's Check tab.
- **Chapters and goals**: `checkpoints[i].goals?: Cond[]` and `GameDef.invariants?: Cond[]` ("never true"). `solve`
  resolves checkpoint to checkpoint by default (each segment bounded), then globally on request; fails if an invariant
  becomes true on a reached path. `--json` output enriched with the segments (the e2e already replays the path).
- **Saves**: `GameDef.saves?: { slots }` (default 1 = today's behaviour). Pause menu: save / load a slot with room, date,
  play time, thumbnail (the room's backdrop). JSON export / import of a slot. Key `<id>.save.<n>`, `<id>.save` migrated to slot 1.
- **Data-only migrations**: `GameDef.migrations?: Array<{ from; renameFlag?; renameItem?; renameRoom?; renameActor?; drop? }>`,
  applied in a chain in `migrate.ts` before the state is completed. `validate`: renames point to existing ids.
- **Content profiler**: `npm run validate -- --report`: per room (hotspots without `look`, verbs on fallback, props that
  never change), per item (obtained where, used how often, consumed), per character (topics, unreachable ones, lines > N).
  Same report in the Studio's Check tab.
- **Demo**: 3 rooms → declared exits, 2 checkpoints with goals, 1 invariant, 3 slots.

### M3 — "Picture" (v1.5, shipped): staging

Files: `src/engine/core/types.ts` (Layout, PropDef, Cmd), `src/engine/dom/room.ts`, `src/engine/dev/editor.ts`,
`tools/pages/placement.ts`, `tools/assets.py`.

- **Wide rooms and camera**: `Layout.width?` (≥ 640, height stays 400); logical coordinates extend; `assets.py` accepts
  backdrops wider than 1280. `GameState.camera: { x, target? }`. Commands `{ camera: 'follow' | { pan, ms } | { to: who } | 'reset' }`.
  `room.ts` translates the scene layer; `shake` already exists. The editor and the placement page show the whole room with
  the camera frame. The solver ignores the camera.
- **Prop animations with frame events**: `PropDef.anims?: Record<name, { frames; fps?; loop?; at?: Record<frame, Cmd[]> }>`;
  commands `{ play: [prop, anim] }`, `{ waitAnim: prop }`. Same `at` on characters' `anim` poses. The solver runs the `at`
  commands in order, without waiting.
- **Voice**: `say` takes `voice?: SoundId`; `GameDef.audio.voices?`; auto-advance at the end of the clip; separate voice
  volume. `refs.ts` / `assets.py` include the clips.
- **Preferences**: `GameDef.ui.settings?` enables text speed, subtitle size, reduced animations / shake, a dyslexia-friendly
  font (provided by the game in `skin.fonts`), music / sfx / voice volumes. Stored outside the save.
- **Demo**: a wider market (1.5 screens) with camera follow; the pantry door animated with an `sfx` on frame 3.

### M4 — "Cast" (v1.6, shipped): several playable characters

Files: `types.ts`, `engine.ts`, state, `dom/app.ts` (inventory, switch button), `solve.ts`, `validate.ts`, `migrate.ts`.

- `GameDef.hero` stays valid (sugar for a single player). New `GameDef.players?: { ids; initial; sharedInventory? }`.
- `GameState.players: Record<Id, { room, inventory, hero: Record<room, Point> }>` + `GameState.active`. The flat
  `room` / `inventory` / `hero` fields become views on the active player (access centralised in `state.ts`). Migration
  provided (`saveVersion` + 1).
- Commands `{ switchPlayer: id }`, `{ transfer: [item, to] }`; condition `{ player: id }`; a switch button in the UI, `ui` texts.
- Solver: switching is an action; the hash includes every player. Validate: an item transferred to a player who can never receive it.
- A dedicated test fixture (see M5); the demo does not need it, a second sample `games/trio` (3 rooms, 2 players) illustrates and tests it end to end.

### M5 — "Open" (v2.0, shipped): openness and robustness

- **Custom commands**: `games/<id>/index.ts` exports `commands?: Record<name, { run(ctx, args); effects?: Cmd[] }>`;
  command `{ custom: name, args }`. The solver applies `effects`; `validate` requires `effects` or `pure: true`.
  Doc: "when the DSL is not enough".
- **Localisation**: `npm run i18n extract` writes `games/<id>/locales/<base>.json` (key = content path, value = text);
  `locales/<lang>.json` overrides at load time; `GameDef.lang` / a selector. Studio: a coverage tab (missing, too long).
  The source content stays inline: nothing changes for the AI writing a game.
- **Micro-game tests**: `tests/fixtures/{scripts,events,actors,exits,saves,camera,players}/`, one room each, one test per
  primitive; the current fixture stays for the base.
- **Studio "Play"**: a tab playing the game in a `?dev` iframe with the state inspector (already in the dev panel) and a
  **rule explainer**: tap a hotspot / item → the candidate rules with every condition evaluated ✓ / ✗ (reuses the core's
  `check`, exposed in dev mode).
- **Minigames**: nothing to code; document the existing registry as `activities` and ship an example in `games/_template`.

## v2.1 "Proof" (shipped): prove the engine rather than extend it

A second audit, on v2.0.1, concluded that the primitives were there and that the next step was proof and tooling, not
more commands. Two of its claims were wrong (`engine.ts` and `types.ts` are under a thousand lines each, not three
thousand), its direction was right. What v2.1 delivered:

- **One catalogue of the commands** (`src/engine/core/cmds.ts`): every key of `Cmd`, which ones hold nested lists, which
  ones change the state, which ones carry text; the validator, the solver, the texts walker and the content tools read
  it. Adding a variant to `Cmd` without listing it fails `tsc`; `tests/cmds.test.ts` runs every command through the
  validator and the engine.
- **The classics** (`docs/en/CLASSICS.md`): twenty famous mechanics of the genre written with the DSL as is, each
  marked native / feasible / custom, five of them played and proven in `tests/classics.test.ts`. Writing them found
  three real solver gaps, fixed: it only ever took the last option of a `choice`, it clamped counters that go down
  (haggling), and it ran a script whole instead of one `wait` at a time (a patrol was never seen in the middle room).
- **The puzzle graph** (`src/engine/tools/puzzle.ts`): what every rule, topic, script and listener needs and changes;
  a card per item, flag, prop, place or event (acquired by, used by, requires first, unlocks, downstream); in the
  Studio's Check tab, as `npm run page:puzzles`, as the `puzzle_graph` tool. The validator uses it to spot a flag only
  set by actions that already need it.
- **The solver prunes what cannot matter**: from the same graph, a flag nobody but its setter reads, a script whose
  effects reach nothing live, a walker nobody waits for are left out of the state. The generated 40-room game went
  from "20 000 states, truncated" to 804 states in a second (`docs/en/BENCH.md`).
- **A generated stress game** (`src/engine/tools/stress.ts`, `npm run bench`): rooms, players, items, flags, walkers,
  scripts, topics, chapters and migrations at any size, every tool timed on it; a small one runs in the tests.
- **Loops honour `at`** for sounds and shakes; the validator refuses a state change there.
- **Translations survive refactors**: `extract --lang xx` follows a text that moved (same source text in the previous
  reference file), parks what disappeared under `_stale:`, revives it when the path returns.

## v2.2 "Studio" (shipped): see the dialogue, see the clock

- **The dialogue tree** (`src/engine/tools/dialogue.ts`): a character's topics as a tree (topics, lines, choices and
  options, branches, each with its condition), derived from the DSL, nothing to keep in sync. In the Studio's Rooms tab
  (a toggle next to the topics; tapping a node jumps to its editor) and as the `dialogue_tree` tool.
- **The journal** (`Engine.trace`, dev mode): what every action answered, events emitted and listeners reached, script
  steps, characters moved, player switches. In the Studio's Play tab (filter by kind) and the dev panel (last ten).

## v2.3 "Replay" (shipped): reproduce, profile, prune

The third audit asked for three things a long game needs more than any primitive: reproduce a tester's bug, know why
the solver is slow or big, and explore fewer equivalent orders. All three come from the same fact: the engine knows
what every action read and changed.

- **The session** (`Engine.session`, always recorded): every input since the game started or a save was loaded
  (actions, map travels, player switches, script steps), with the answers given on the way (choices, map, random draws)
  and what answered (the puzzle graph's ids). "Export session" in the game's save menu, in the dev panel and in the
  Studio's Play tab; `npm run replay -- file.json` plays it on the real engine without a display and says where it
  stops matching (`src/engine/tools/replay.ts`). A bug report is a session file and a screenshot; the Play tab's
  **Replay** scrubs through it and lands the game anywhere on the way.
- **The solver's solution is a session** (`SolveResult.steps`): `replay()` proves it, the e2e harness taps it (no more
  label parsing), and CI plays the sample game in Chromium on every push.
- **The solver profile** (`npm run solve -- --profile`, the Check tab's "Solver health", the `solve` tool with
  `profile: true`): states, engine runs, no-ops, what the states are made of (which dimension splits them most), states
  by room, what answered most (a heat map on the puzzle graph), use/give combinations that could only fall back,
  independent dimensions (a checkpoint between them would cut the states), monotonic things. Actions no written rule
  can answer are not run at all any more: three times fewer engine runs on the sample game.
- **Why is this live?** (`liveClasses`, `whyLive` in `src/engine/tools/puzzle.ts`): every node of the puzzle graph is
  *critical* (it reaches the end, a goal or an invariant), *world*, *visible* or *dead* (out of the solver's state); a
  card shows the chain; "Critical path" fades the rest of the graph.
- **Partial-order reduction** (`src/engine/tools/por.ts`, `npm run solve -- --por=sleep|stubborn`): actions that
  touch different things commute. `sleep` skips the orders already covered (fewer runs, the same states); `stubborn`
  explores one of several commuting actions at a time (fewer states too: k independent pickups before a door are k + 1
  states instead of 2^k). Off by default, the plain search stays the proof; `tests/por.test.ts` checks that every
  fixture gives the same answers in all three modes.
- **Custom commands checked** in dev mode: a `run` that changes the state outside its declared `effects` is reported
  in the journal.
- Two holes of the state hash closed (`visited`, the counters of `random` blocks); the dialogue tree's lines jump to
  their editor again.

## v2.4 "Author" (shipped): the story against the game, the cutscene against the clock

- **Storyboard coverage** (`src/engine/tools/coverage.ts`): the storyboard (`games/<id>/storyboard.json`) checked
  against the content: rooms, speakers, talk characters and sounds by id; panel actions ("Open Grandpa's armchair",
  "Use pipe with tank", "Talk to Lou: Where is the key?") parsed with the game's verbs and the names of the things in the
  room, then looked up in the rules, the kind reactions, the topics and the look lines; lines, topics and hints by
  text (exact, close, or absent). Every check is *ok*, *partial* (the pieces exist, no rule answers; a close line),
  *missing* or *unknown* (prose). Badges on the boards and panels of the Studio's Storyboard tab (with the list of
  what is not there yet), a "Storyboard coverage" panel in Check, the `storyboard_coverage` tool (20 tools).
- **The cutscene timeline** (`src/engine/tools/timeline.ts`, `src/engine/core/timing.ts`): how long a command list
  takes and what overlaps, read from the DSL as written: lines last as the presenter shows them, walks as far as the
  layout says, animations their frames, `parallel` branches on their own lanes, a choice or a minigame marked as the
  player's turn. A "Timeline" toggle next to every cutscene, arrival script and world script in the Rooms tab; tap a
  bar to jump to its line. The presenter's durations now come from one file.
- Dominance pruning (the auditor's fifth stage) was not done: on the sample game, the private game and the stress game
  the profile shows no dimension where monotonic things dominate; it stays a note in `docs/en/BENCH.md`.

## v2.5 "Sound" (shipped): music and effects from one palette

- **The audio pipeline** (`tools/audio`, `npm run audio`, `docs/en/AUDIO.md`): a MIDI (or an audio file, transcribed)
  becomes a Sega Mega Drive arrangement (YM2612 FM + SN76489 PSG + DAC drums) written as a `spec.json` the assistant
  authors from an automatic analysis (tracks, ranges, doublings, sections); Furnace renders `.fur`, `.wav`, `.vgm`,
  `.mp3`; a QA report measures every channel against the palette's targets, the pitch accuracy and the peak. One
  palette (`tools/audio/palette.json`) for every track of every game, the way one style block serves every image.
- **Sound effects from the same palette** (`games/<id>/audio/sfx.json`, `npm run audio -- sfx`): short recipes on the
  FM, PSG and noise channels, rendered, trimmed and normalised to `audio/sfx/*.mp3`. The sample game's nineteen
  effects are now Mega Drive renders instead of Kenney samples, and it has a theme: the opening of Tchaikovsky's
  *Swan Lake* (public domain), played on the title screen and in every room.
- Vendor-neutral: the workflow and the rules live in `docs/en/AUDIO.md` (`read_doc AUDIO` through MCP), `AGENTS.md`
  names the command and the licence rule; the Claude skill only points there.
- Not done, on purpose: adaptive music (iMUSE-like transitions); Furnace is downloaded by `setup`, not bundled; CI
  does not render audio (the files are committed).

## v3 "Trust" (shipped 4 October 2026): the engine you can trust a long game to

Co-developed by two assistants under `docs/dev/CHARTER.md`; the exchange is `docs/dev/LOG.md`, the decisions
`docs/dev/DECISIONS.md`. v3 may break v2 (D1): every break ships with its migration and an upgrading guide, and the
private reference game is migrated on a branch before v3.0.0 is tagged. Since v3.0.0, `main` is the release branch and
each `v3-<topic>` merges there as it passes its gates (D7).

The opening proposal is Codex's beta (`v3-beta1`, log #1), reviewed in log #2. Its topics, each a `v3-<topic>` branch
when split out:

- **saves**: a validated save envelope, an IndexedDB autosave read back after each write, visible storage failures,
  a PWA update that waits for a verified save; stale references pruned, not rejected.
- **prove**: `solve -- --prove` with an honest `status`, softlocks by reverse reachability, `random` and nested
  choices explored; the proof stays outside `npm run build` or runs with the reduction and a budget.
- **ids**: `schemaVersion: 3` with stable ids on rules, choices, topics, listeners, persistent blocks and script steps;
  one naming function shared by the engine, the solver and the puzzle graph.
- **studio-security**: loopback by default, LAN token, same-origin writes, key in sessionStorage.
- **ci**: production-build e2e, WebKit smoke test (non-blocking until three green runs), `doctor`, `audit:deps`.
- **offline**: budgeted room/neighbor warming, with an explicit cached-rooms offline contract instead of an unbounded
  whole-game download.
- **upgrading**: `docs/en/UPGRADING.md` + `docs/fr/UPGRADING.md`, the v2 → v3 checklist, run on the private reference game.

## v3.1 "Playtest" (shipped 4 October 2026): what v3.0.0 left open, then two tools a studio expects

One `v3-<topic>` branch at a time, each with its log entry, tests, docs in both languages and a CI run, merged into
`main` as it passed: `v3-webkit` (the generic replay from the title; WebKit gates after its three green runs),
`v3-ids` (`npm run ids`, the sample game on schema 3, translation paths by id), `v3-boot` (`bootGame`; the
precache fix of the two-entry build), `v3-slots` (slots in IndexedDB), `v3-offline` (the whole game offline after
the first visit, D5), `v3-a11y` (a whole game at the keyboard), `v3-lint` (the content lint), `v3-playtests`
(sessions from phones replayed in CI, stalls on the heat map), `v3-ci` (the proof measured honestly, release and
prove workflows, Dependabot), `v3-docs` (this sweep). Next for the solver: the reduction in proof mode, with
`tests/por.test.ts` as its proof (BENCH.md).

## v3.1.1 "Truth" (4 October 2026): every green command means exactly what it says

Codex's audit of 3.1 (LOG #24) found tools that could report success without proving their wording; the maintainer
chose to patch before building (LOG #25, #26). `v3-qa-truth`: the e2e requires a `solved` solver run and the engine's
own `state.done` (a sealed ending now sets it), the playtest analysis counts from the first input, the lint exits 2 on a
truncated search and reads every attempted action, `verify:game` lints, `playtests --strict` gates releases.
`v3-offline-truth`: the warm-up returns what it did, the status is `complete` only when every file is cached, the
pause menu shows it, the PWA smoke checks the whole plan and never counts WebKit's skip as a proof.
`v3-studio-net`: private hosts refused in both IP families, no redirect, a deadline and a cap on provider calls.
`v3-release-truth`: the release runs on the CI's success for the tag, a golden 3.1.0 save, the full dependency audit,
D5/D7/D8/D9 recorded. The private reference game stays on 3.1.0 (D8).

## v3.2 "Production" (4 October 2026): identity, saves, proof, accessibility and assets a team can rely on

The second half of Codex's horizon (LOG #25), one branch at a time, each merged on green CI (D9): `v32-bindings`
(one table of the engine's English texts, a release-language e2e that fails on any visible default, minigame
bindings validated), `v32-line-ids` (a stable id per line: translations and voices follow it, `npm run ids --
--lines`), `v32-save-results` (clear and import say what they did and never lose the game, golden saves for 3.0.0
and 3.1.0, a save round trip in a real browser with and without IndexedDB), `v32-proof-scale` (every softlock counted
and grouped by cause, the proof by chapters from every reachable boundary state, checkpoints checked, one budget; the
reductions measured and kept out of proof mode; BENCH.md says where the proof stops: multi-character games),
`v32-a11y-gate` (every bundled minigame plays at the keyboard, axe-core on four screens, the keyboard row gates),
`v32-assets-provenance` (`provenance.json` for every shipped asset), `v32-release` (a second game made by `new-game`
passes every gate in CI). Out of 3.2, said in BENCH.md and ENGINE.md: proving a multi-character long game (the 3.3 solver track below), a
screen-reader pass (manual), DNS pinning of custom providers.

## v3.3 "Scale" (5 October 2026): prove multi-character games, close the production contracts

From an outside review (LOG #38) and Codex's reviews of 3.2 (LOG #39, #40), one branch at a time, each merged on
green CI (D9). The proof: `v33-proof-profile` (where the time goes, `npm run bench -- --matrix`), `v33-proof-core`
(a heap frontier and parent pointers: the queue went from 89% of the time to nothing, same witnesses),
`v33-player-canonical` (states that differ only by who is active are one state), `v33-mobility` (mobility regions:
silent moves folded into the next action, an exact fallback when a move is not silent), `v33-chapter-interfaces`
(one shared search per chapter from every boundary state, a goal checked on every character's view: a real bug
found against the explicit search), `v33-noop-memo` (the partial-order reduction measured in proof mode and refused:
it reported a softlock that does not exist; instead the engine's writes are traced and a try that wrote nothing is
not run again on the same read values, every skip checkable), `v33-one-status` (one status, exit code and sentence
for the CLI, its JSON, the Studio and the MCP tool), `v33-proof-cache` (a result keyed by the engine, the game and the
options, given back when nothing changed). Production: `v33-list-ids` (look lists, hints, fallback answers and
reactions by kind get stable ids), `v33-provenance-lock` (a reviewed lock of every shipped file and a licence policy,
both required for a release), `v33-asset-weight` (what a phone downloads before the first room, per room and per
chapter, held to budgets), `v33-browser-gates` (axe-core on dialogues, the map, the save slots and every minigame;
every minigame won at the keyboard in a real browser; storage upgrades in Chromium and WebKit).

Exit criteria, measured (BENCH.md "v3.3"): the 40-room, 3-character reference game (structured by eras) proved in 578 states and 3.5 s
(budget 200 000 states, 60 s); the demo proved in 2.2 s (budget 5 s) and by chapters in 3.3 s (budget 20 s); the
abstractions give the explicit search's verdicts on the differential corpus (`tests/reference-proof.test.ts`,
`tests/memo.test.ts`, `tests/canonical.test.ts`); the profile says what each abstraction did or why it is off; one
status everywhere; CI on `v33-*`. Not done, said here: parallel workers (each chapter is one shared search and
chapters follow each other: nothing independent is left to split, and every budget is met), dominance between
boundary states and a symbolic backend (no game exceeds the budgets), a manual screen-reader pass (the maintainer's,
checklist in `docs/dev/`), the open 3-character matrix where items move freely between characters (a true product
of item placements, BENCH.md). Stagecraft (layers, walk topology, structured Studio editors, voice production) moves
to 3.4.

## v3.3.1 "Truth" (5 October 2026): what 3.3.0 promised, made exact

From Codex's review of 3.3.0 (LOG #55), one branch at a time (D9): `v331-docs-truth` (the partial-order reduction
marked historical and refused in proofs, the memo "checked, not proved", the reference "structured by eras", no WCAG
claim, the manual pass sheets), `v331-abstraction-audit` (`solve --audit-abstractions` on any game, 120 random games
and one game per command and condition; it found a flaw of the base search, rule shadowing missing from the liveness
analysis, fixed), `v331-commercial` (`verify:commercial`; release exceptions printed by name), `v331-ci-gates`
(WebKit at the keyboard and the French game gate; a Safari offline checklist), `v331-release` (the built game, an SBOM
and an attestation on the GitHub release; the notes list the manual passes, D12).

## v3.4 "Stagecraft" (5 October 2026): picture, scene and Studio

Decided with the maintainer (D10, D11, D13), from Codex's 3.4 plan and its extension, one branch at a time (D9), in
dependency order:

- `v34-asset-graph`: one graph of the files each part of the game needs (title, rooms, map, offline), read by
  preloading, the offline plan, provenance and `npm run weight`; `npm run e2e:weight` checks it against the bytes a
  browser really transfers (a CI gate). Fonts through the bundler, a Latin subset.
- `v34-renderer-contract`: the scene model (`RoomView`) and its painters; the DOM painter is the reference; visual
  baselines for every room (`npm run e2e:visual`).
- `v34-stage-schema`: `RoomDef.stage` (layers, lights, emitters, transition, links' conditions) and the layout's
  geometry; old rooms normalised, nothing to rewrite (UPGRADING §11); 3.x saves unchanged.
- `v34-canvas`: the Canvas 2D painter (D10), the DOM overlay for the interface and accessibility; parity with the DOM
  references; `npm run e2e:perf` (CPU slowed 4×, a CI gate).
- `v34-layers-masks`: parallax, occluders (polygon, mask image, a layer's alpha, feathered or inverted), lights,
  seeded particles, transitions; reduced motion honoured.
- `v34-walk-topology`: walk zones and links (walk, stairs, ladder, jump, teleport), a depth scale and a camera zoom
  per zone; a closed link stops the walk, never the action (lint `walk-link-gate`).
- `v34-stage-physics`: `launch`, `spring`, `path`, `follow`, closed forms of time, presentation only.
- `v34-voice-production`: `npm run voices` (the table per language, CSV out and back, every clip checked with ffmpeg),
  music ducked under voices, captions for the sounds that matter.
- `v34-studio`: structured editing (forms for reactions, conditions, commands and stages, a diff preview, validated
  atomic writes, undo / redo), the stage's geometry in the editor, the Voices tab, `set_value` for AIs.
- `v34-reference`: "The Night Market" (`games/reference`), the second real game, the exit gate.

Exit criteria, as measured (BENCH 3.4): the first visit inside the weight prediction; the sample game's rooms and the
reference's against their baselines; the whole game played by the Canvas painter; 3.0–3.3 golden saves resumed to the
end; the market with 6 layers, parallax and 3 masks at 50 fps with the CPU slowed 4× (47 at 8×); a character crossing
two zones by stairs and two planes by a ladder and a jump; the Studio creating and undoing a stage in a browser; no
layer or link carrying logic (lint and test); the reference proved whole and by chapters and played to the end at the
keyboard in Chromium and WebKit, and in French. Reported, not done by hand (D12, `docs/dev/passes/3.4.0.md`): the
screen reader, testers, a real phone, Safari offline, recorded voices, a signed tag. Left for later: lip-sync markers
in the voice table.

## v3.5 "Score" (5 October 2026): music, workers, inventories

From the plan decided with the maintainer (D11), one branch at a time (D9):

- `v35-music-director`: a track can have a score (`audio.scores`), its stems rendered from the arrangement
  (`npm run audio -- stems`), played sample-locked on Web Audio; the mix follows the game's state (a flag, the room,
  the active character) on the next bar, crossfaded; stingers on the beat; the single mix where the director does not
  fit (Save-Data, a low-end device). The Studio's Music tab. `npm run e2e:music` (CI): 30 minutes without a sample
  of drift, 100 changes without a click, real-time jitter 0.02 ms in Chromium and WebKit.
- `v35-proof-workers`: the frontier expanded in batches by worker threads, merged in the batch's order: the same
  result for 1, 2, 4 and 8 workers, ×2.54 with 4 on a 40 000-state proof. Off unless asked for (`--workers`).
- `v35-inventory-ownership`: the canonical owner pools the items no condition reads while the characters can meet,
  the hand-overs played and checked; audited against the explicit search. The reference chapter 904 → 288 states,
  the open 20 × 2 matrix proved. Witness dominance as an option (it prunes nothing on the bundled games).

Exit criteria, as measured (BENCH.md "3.5"): the director's three gates green in CI; workers identical for 1, 2, 4, 8
and ×2 with 4; the owner never diverging from the explicit search. **Missed, not blocking (D11):** the open matrix of
20 rooms × 3 characters stays truncated at 200 000 states: the owner applies only while every two characters can
meet, and locked doors keep them apart. Reported, not done by hand (D12, `docs/dev/passes/3.5.0.md`): the screen
reader, testers, a real phone, Safari offline, recorded voices, a signed tag.

## v3.5.1 "Cue" (5 October 2026): the review's fixes

- The music director plays only the latest request (a slow score no longer replaces the one asked after it; a stop
  cancels a score still loading).
- A browser that does not tell its memory gets stems only for scores of 128 MB decoded at most (`pcmBytes`).
- A proof worker that stops mid-search leaves the pool, and `stats()` has a timeout. The workers table reports the
  peak RSS: 1.2 GB with 4 workers.
- The weight test no longer depends on an earlier `dist`.

## v3.6 "Production" (5 October 2026): the rest of the 3.5.0 review

- `v36-budgets`: weight budgets for the stems (`backgroundScoreKB`), the full offline warm-up (`offlineTotalKB`) and
  the largest score decoded (`decodedAudioMB`), required by a release.
- `v36-stem-probe`: `validate --release` measures the stem files with ffprobe: rate, channels, exact samples, the loop
  inside, `pcmBytes` right.
- `v36-pcm-cache`: the director keeps at most `audio.maxDecodedMB` of decoded audio, least recently played let go; a
  score larger than that plays as its single mix.
- `v36-transitions`: `audio.transitions` (beat, bar, phrase or a marker, a bridge, a crossfade), measured to the
  sample; a save keeps the music's phase and loading resumes there.
- `v36-solver-structure`: the canonical owner pools by group of characters who can meet; a timer leak of 15 MB a
  search fixed; the audit compares live flags; `npm run audit:corpus`, nightly on 500 seeds.

Exit criteria, as measured (BENCH.md "3.6"): every new budget set and held on both games; the stem probe green on
the demo and red on inconsistent files; transitions and the phase to the sample; 900 random games tried, 549 verdicts compared to
the explicit search without a divergence (351 stopped partial, not compared). **Missed again, not blocking:** the open matrix of 20 rooms × 3 characters stays truncated, now at 600 000 states (40 minutes, 7.6 GB): pooling by group proves 12 and 14 rooms, not 20. Reported, not done by hand (D12, `docs/dev/passes/3.6.0.md`): the screen reader, testers, a
real phone, Safari offline, recorded voices, a signed tag, a listening pass.

## v3.6.1 "Audio truth" (5 October 2026): the 3.6.0 review's fixes

- `v361-director-lifecycle`: the director owns what it schedules. A transition not landed yet is a plan that a stop,
  a restore or a new request cancels (no bridge after them); `restore()`; one duck bus under everything it plays;
  every buffer under the cap (a bridge that does not fit is dropped, two scores that do not fit cut, stingers evict).
- `v361-audio-intents`: `play`, `restore`, `stop`. Loading a save restores its music at its point, even when it is the
  one playing, never through a transition; a fallback to the mix keeps the point.
- `v361-budgets-peak`: `transitionPeakMB` (two scores, a bridge and a stinger decoded at once); `validate` refuses a
  rule an earlier one covers and a marker from `'*'` a score lacks.
- `v361-release`: the nightly keeps its counts (tried, compared, partial, diverged) as an artifact; README screenshots
  of 3.6; the corpus claims say "tried" and "compared".

Exit criteria, as measured: the 9 lifecycle cases fail on 3.6.0 and pass; `npm run e2e:music` loads a save while its
score plays on and comes back to within 0.1 s of the saved point. Reported (D12, `docs/dev/passes/3.6.1.md`): the
same human passes, and a signed tag (no key on this machine).

## v3.7 "Field Proof" (5 October 2026): what can be proved without a person

- `v37-own-theme`: the sample game's theme written for the project (Swan Lake's oboe theme, public domain, with its
  own harmony and arrangement): no release exception left, `verify:commercial` green on both games.
- `v37-reference-scores`: the reference market's own score and two bridges; `e2e:music --only=reference` in CI
  (handover, restore before a landing, stop while waiting, the decoded peak under `transitionPeakMB`).
- `v37-corpus-shards`: the nightly corpus in four jobs, added up by a fifth.

Exit criteria, as measured: `npm run verify:commercial` green on the demo and the reference; the reference scenario
green in Chromium (bridge 5.47 s, restore within 0.1 s, peak 130 MB for a budget of 150). Not done, the human part of
"Field Proof" (D12, `docs/dev/passes/3.7.0.md`): an iPhone/Safari and an Android/Chrome pass, VoiceOver or TalkBack,
five external players, Safari offline, recorded voices on a full dialogue, a listening pass on both scores and their
bridges, a signed tag.

## v3.7.1 "Artifact Truth" (5 October 2026): the review of 3.7.0

- `fix/stinger-cap`: a stinger that does not fit beside the score is streamed, never decoded over the cap.
- `fix/dist-inventory`: the build holds this game's files only, with `licenses/`; `npm run verify:dist` accounts for
  every file.
- `fix/playtest-quotas`: `--strict` honest about zero sessions; `verify:field` with its quotas.
- `fix/workflows`: topic branches by kind, releases from the tested SHA and never replaced, exact nightly shards.
- `fix/repo-hygiene`: the README's release line held to `package.json`; no tracked bytecode.
- `feature/player-split` (merged early): zod/mini, minigames on demand, `initialJsKB`, the engine's layers checked.

Exit criterion, as measured: `inventory(dist)` = code + locked assets + named data + fonts + icons + licences, on the
demo (242 files) and the reference (225); the four-shard nightly on 501 seeds of each kind (910 compared, 0 diverged).

## The way to 4.0 (planned with the 3.7.0 review, LOG #91)

- **3.8 "Human Proof"** (shipped 5 October 2026), the machine part: the two-score scenario in WebKit, the field kit (`docs/en/FIELD.md`, near
  misses, `?fps`). The seven human passes stay the maintainer's (D12). No large engine primitive.
- **3.9 "Independence"** (shipped 5 October 2026): the engine as a package (`web-scumm`, `create-web-scumm`, the `web-scumm` command), a game
  outside the repository built from the packed template (The Lighthouse), `npm run fresh-install` in CI.
- **4.0 "Stable Platform"** (shipped 5 October 2026): the public API in four entries with its surface held by a test, a support and
  deprecation policy, the save line of 3.x loaded in 4.x, the independent game moved from 3.9 to 4.0.
- Left to research, not a 4.0 gate: exact dominance on relevant items, the 20 × 3 matrix (a criterion only if a real
  game needs it).

## v4.0 "Stable Platform" (5 October 2026)

- `feature/contracts` (in 3.9): the public API in four entries, its surface and the MCP tools' arguments held by a
  test, `docs/en/API.md`, `docs/en/SUPPORT.md`.
- `feature/upgrade-proof`: `npm run upgrade-check`, a game moved from the previous release with its save, in CI.
- The Lighthouse, moved from 3.9.0 to 4.0.0.

Exit criteria, as measured: `fresh-install` and `upgrade` green in CI; the Lighthouse's `release --commercial` green
on 4.0.0 and its 3.9.0 save played to the end; one save per release from 3.0.0 to 4.0.0 reaching the ending.
Reported, not done (D12): the seven field passes (`docs/en/FIELD.md`), a game by someone else, publishing to npm, a
signed tag, GitHub's immutable releases setting.

## v4.1.0 "Clarity" (shipped 6 October 2026, D14): easier to read, review and contribute to

Codex's plan `docs/dev/PLAN-4.1.1-CLARITY.md`: no gameplay change, no change to the public API, the content or the
saves. A behaviour baseline first (digests, solver verdicts, API surface), then Biome and stricter TypeScript, the four
files over 1,000 lines split by responsibility (engine, types, player, solver), typed data boundaries, coverage and
mutation testing, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CODE_TOUR.md`, ADRs and a contribution guide. Reported (D12): a review by
someone who did not build the engine.

As measured at the tag: the four files over 1,000 lines split (`engine.ts` 795, `app.ts` 780, `solve.ts` a facade
over five modules, `types.ts` a facade over six), seven files of `src/` over 800 lines kept with their reason and
capped; 464 index accesses checked in `src/`; no explicit `any` in `src/` or `tools/`; the same witnesses, proofs and
golden saves as 4.0.0 on 15 games and 13 saves; proof time +1%; first visit 122 → 120 KB; coverage floors with every
branch of conditions, saves, migrations and diffs; 340 of 348 mutants killed, the 8 others explained.

## v4.1.1 "Reality Bridge" (shipped 6 October 2026, D14): a game reacts to the world outside

Codex's plan `docs/dev/PLAN-4.1-REALITY-BRIDGE.md`, on the clarified code: a game declares a finite alphabet of
signals; a separate Bridge (pairing, Biscuit capabilities, signed events, a journal) delivers them at least once; the
engine applies each at most once, saves, then acknowledges; a session replays them offline; the solver proves a game
closed, under a scenario, or against absences and duplicates. A spike settles the envelope, transport and Biscuit
first. A game without `reality` pays no code and no request. Reported (D12): a deployed Bridge, a real webhook.

As measured at the tag: the spike's choices (a compact EdDSA JWS verified by WebCrypto, 381 bytes gzipped; Biscuit on
the Bridge, its 49 official validations and the project's 22 signed cases and 9 policy cases giving the same verdict
in JavaScript and Rust; SSE and a fetch by cursor); crash tests at every boundary of delivery; the sample game proved
in four worlds; the plan's end-to-end scenario green in Chromium and WebKit (offline reopening on Chromium); the demo
without a byte of Reality in its first visit or its offline cache.

The project stays on 4.1.x for a while; 4.2 will be the final version.

## v4.1.2 "Reliable Bridge" (shipped 6 October 2026): the Bridge made true

The maintainer asked for a hard critique of the whole project and a plan towards professional quality, framed by
three decisions: a reliable engine for a small studio, nothing cut from the core, the cadence kept. An outside review
of 4.1.1's Bridge arrived with it and was checked against the code: proposals were not atomic (a shared sequence, a
signal lost), a save's cursor was acknowledged for whoever held the device, a rotation stranded a player; its
"signal lost between the backlog and the subscription" did not exist. Six lots, one branch each, each with its
tests: transactions, the link's identity, transport and rotation, the Bridge's surface, the fallback proof, and
falsification (a mutation set for what a signal rests on, measured at 382 of 484 and listed honestly; properties at
random; a compiled package installed by CI; the Studio's host guard). The plan's next releases, each a quality
topic at a frozen scope: 4.1.3 the gates (a ruleset on `main`, build once, the heavy solver tests out of the push),
4.1.4 the engine's honesty (`destroy`, an error port, a clock-only determinism, hooks instead of patches), 4.1.5 the
core's real split, 4.1.6 the tooling a studio touches, 4.1.7 the documentation, then 4.2.0 final (a compiled
package, npm, a host API).

## v4.1.3 "Honest Gates" (shipped 6 October 2026): the CI made trustworthy

Nothing in the game, everything in what guards it: workflows that read only, cancel, stop and pin; the unit suite
once per push and the CPU-bound solver tests nightly (the push suite's whole instability); coverage and baseline
ratchets that say what they could hold; `release-check` as CI runs it; a ruleset on `main` (the gates required, no
force push, no deletion) and merges by pull request; Dependabot alerts on, 233 merged branches and 52 worktrees gone.
The refactorings of 4.1.4 and 4.1.5 lean on these gates.

## v4.1.4 "Honest Engine" (shipped 6 October 2026): what the engine does when things end or fail

`destroy` on the engine and the player (no loop, listener, frame or blob URL left), an error port (a script that
throws is stopped and marked so in the save), time from the injected clock alone, hooks instead of patched methods,
`waitUntil` woken by the change that satisfies it, the state's keys in one module, English placeholders with the 4.0
names kept, dead code gone and `knip` on guard for dead files and dependencies. The next release, 4.1.5, makes the
split of 4.1.0 real: `step()` as a table, sub-objects that own their state, the player decomposed, rendering diffed.

## v4.1.5 "Real Core" (shipped 6 October 2026): the split that 4.1.0 announced

`step()` as a table of handlers (`core/command-handlers.ts`), the script loops owned by `ScriptScheduler`, the session
by `SessionLog` (`Engine.sessions`), the room view's camera and walking by `Camera` and `Walker` (`view.camera`,
`view.walker`); the keyboard targets and the inventory diffed on a state change, the stage re-sent only when one of
its conditions changes, the guests computed once per `targets()`; `dom/room.ts` from 1026 lines to 744, off the
exceptions list; the step table and the scheduler in the core mutation set. Behaviour identical at every step (the
quality baseline, the visual baselines, the frame-rate gate). Left for later, said as such: `busyCount`, `guideWait`
and `skipping` stay on the Engine; the player (`dom/app.ts`) is not decomposed; the Canvas painter still builds its
draw list per frame. The next release, 4.1.6, is the studio's tool: the npm scripts, no tracked file written by
`dev` or `new-game`, Python out of the build path, Windows, the Studio's tabs, the player's touch targets.

## v4.1.6 "Studio Tool" (shipped 6 October 2026): what a studio touches every day

No tracked file written by `dev`, `check`, `build` or `new-game` (the current game is `.cache/game`, a link
`npm run game` points; tsconfig.json's `@game` paths look there); `npm run build` without Python (the pixel tests
stay in `npm test` and CI); `npm run doctor` with required (Node, Chromium) and optional (Python, its modules, ffmpeg,
WebKit) prerequisites, exit 0 when only optional ones are missing; `cross-env` and Node for the scripts that set a
variable or make a directory (Windows); `requirements.txt` pinned; the Vite plugins in `tools/vite/plugins.ts`;
`set_layout` validated and taken back like `set_value`; the MCP server's version from package.json; `web-scumm
doctor` and `web-scumm mcp`; verbs 44 px high on a phone, no `maximum-scale`, `prefers-reduced-motion` complete,
the focused target's label 12 px; `packageManager` and `.nvmrc`. Left for later, said as such: the npm scripts are
not consolidated into twelve verbs (81 remain, documented in TOOLS.md); the Studio's tabs are not split into
view/state/io and have no test per tab; the Check tab still speaks the solver's language; `sirv-cli` stays where it
is. The next release, 4.1.7, is the documentation for a studio: a README worth reading, API reference from TSDoc, a
first-room tutorial, French parity checked, governance files.

## v4.1.7 "Docs for a Studio" (shipped 6 October 2026): the documentation a studio reads first

The READMEs rewritten in both languages (one pitch, three commands, what each role gets, the screenshots taken again,
one table of numbers, the release in one paragraph, a non-affiliation note); `TUTORIAL.md`, a first room in fifteen
minutes; `API.md` with the public API's signatures generated from the sources (`tools/api-doc.ts`, held by a test);
`SUPPORT.md` with the 4.1.x policy said once and a support matrix; the French `STUDIO.md` complete, and a test that
keeps every French page within a third of its English twin, section by section; every relative link checked; every
npm script documented in `TOOLS.md` and tested so; `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` without the pair work of v3; release
notes without the work log's numbers; a code of conduct, a pull request template, a feature issue template, the wiki
off. Left for later, said as such: the API reference carries signatures and first doc lines, not examples per name;
no link checker fetches external URLs. What came next was planned as 4.2.0 "Finale"; on 7 October 2026 the
maintainer replaced it with the programme below (D18), and "Finale" became its last step, 4.2.0 "Stable World".

## v4.1.8 "Foundation Reset" (shipped 7 October 2026): the foundation modernised, the gates made to block

The first release of the programme below. The toolchain: TypeScript 7 native (the type checks in half a second, no
`baseUrl`; `web-scumm migrate` rewrites an older project's tsconfig), Vite 8 on Rolldown (the sample game builds in
half a second, the first visit at 120 KB gzipped), vite-plugin-pwa 2, Node 22.12. The P0: a signal handed to the game
and not acknowledged was lost to its connection; the port keeps three cursors and asks again from the durable one
(reproduced in polling by the maintainer, fixed with its reproduction as the test). The PWA proven in Chromium, WebKit
and Firefox: install, update after a durable save, an update whose fetch fails, a reinstall; two defects found by those
scenarios fixed (the update from the title screen, the warm-up before the worker's control). The release check predicts
the release (`doctor --release`, tracked files only in the packages, the three archives installed, the coverage ratchet
strict, the release verified after publication); the mutation gate keyed by its inputs on both sets, every survivor
named; Windows in CI; `npm run ship` as the release chain. The Studio's three biggest files split into model, IO and
views with 105 tests; every public export carries `@public` or `@extension` and a sentence; the READMEs' figures
written by the baseline; a links script. Left for later, said as such: the human passes of the sheet
(`docs/dev/passes/4.1.8.md`), the release workflow's acceleration (its own lot), the assistant tab's 845 lines.

## v4.1.15 "Remix" (shipped 7 October 2026): one game, several worlds; the release candidate of 4.2

The programme's eighth and last release, the fourth with a release candidate (`v4.1.15-rc.1`, then `v4.1.15` on the
same commit), and the release candidate of 4.2: the DSL and the IR are frozen (D28, `docs/dev/DSL-STABILITY.md`). A
game may declare a variation manifest (`remix`: dimensions, domains, constraints, tagged anchors); `GameIR +
VariationManifest + seed + algorithmVersion` give an immutable `WorldVariant` (ADR 0018), the same on Node and in the
browsers (Node-tested; the cross-runtime check is written, not yet in CI), a malformed seed or an unknown version an
explicit error, never a silent default. Items sit among anchors the validator checks (reachable, not behind their own
item), actors' starting rooms and rounds vary, a hint and its answer are one coupled assignment, puzzle order is a
dependency graph (the rules are never reordered), presentation draws from its own stream and never writes a flag
(D27); `Math.random` is banned from the logical path by a lint rule and two tests. Every bundled mode is a catalogue
(D25) and `npm run verify:variants`, inside `verify:game`, proves each world with a certificate. The save envelope v4
carries the world; a v3 save gets the story; a save of another world is kept, never overwritten without the player's
choice. The title screen offers Story, a new world, a typed seed or the daily challenge; seed codes carry a check
symbol; the Bridge commits the day's seed and reveals it after, checked offline (D26; Mystery seeds can be shopped
within limits said in the threat model). The code wheel is a playful reconstruction, accessible, printable (`npm run
code-wheel`); the Studio's Remix tab previews, locks, compares, measures bias; the reference chapter plays in Story,
Remix and daily, with twenty playtest seeds replayed. Left for later, said as such: `e2e:remix` and `e2e:a11y` over
the wheel (written, not run), the five human seeds, the daily module's mount on the Bridge's server, the `variant`
field in the `.wsrun` envelope, the wheel's record in the session, the wheel's `story` ending.

## v4.1.14 "Time Attack" (shipped 7 October 2026): a run, its clock, its proof, its verifier

The programme's seventh release, the third with a release candidate (`v4.1.14-rc.1`, then `v4.1.14` on the same
commit). A speedrun category is declared in content (`GameDef.speedrun`: timing on RTA, IGT or Active IGT, start and
finish on semantic events, saves, pauses, hints, reloads, the Reality policy, the fingerprint components a run must
match, a fixed or random seed; splits; the rules' version), validated by `npm run validate`, with no change of the
engine; the reference chapter declares Any%, Any% No Hints and Real Time. `Engine.runClock` (ADR 0016, D24) reads RTA
(never an authority), logical steps and logical time in microticks from the declared durations; it observes the engine
and never writes the state. `core/prng.ts` (xoshiro128**, versioned, a stream per purpose, test vectors) seeds
`engine.random`, a breaking change with its migration (UPGRADING §26), as is `SESSION_MAX` 500, the size of a run's
chunk: a run is a chained journal in IndexedDB that resumes after a closed tab or a crash. A `.wsrun` chains every
input by SHA-256 from the category's rules to a final proof; `npm run speedrun:verify`, the CLI and the MCP tool
replay it with its seed to one verdict with a code (thirty alterations each refused); Reality categories keep each
signal's JWS. Integrity is not authenticity: `replay-valid` admits tool-assisted runs and crash resumes, a random seed
is the client's choice, only a witness or a moderator says more (ADR 0017, SPEEDRUN). Local records, a ghost on
semantic targets, `.wsroute` routes, the Studio's speedrun panel; OBS and LiveSplit as local tools (D23); on the
Bridge, `runsRoute` (a queue, an isolated verification worker with bounded heap and time, no secret, in-process
network refusals that are not an isolation, leaderboards per category and seed kind, moderation, retention, a run
identified by its inputs). A complete Any% run of the reference chapter is attached to the release and verified by
`release.yml`. Left for later, said as such: the server-witnessed level, the pinned-version replay, OS-level isolation
of the worker, a SQL run store and the `/v1/runs` mount, `e2e:speedrun` in CI, the mutation sets for the new core
modules, real OBS and LiveSplit sessions and speedrunners' field tests.

## v4.1.13 "Solver Research" (shipped 7 October 2026): the solver measured, lighter, resumable; not yet at scale

The programme's sixth release, named by the two thresholds `docs/dev/plans/4.1.13-proof-at-scale.md` fixed before any
code: the minimum (a measured gain, a compact representation, checkpoint and resume, identical verdicts to the
exhaustive search on the small instances, no false proof) is met, the release objective (the matrix within budget) is
not, so the version does not call itself "Proof at Scale". `docs/dev/PROOF-MATRIX.md` was frozen first: twelve
generated games of 20 to 40 rooms and three characters, six constrained and six open, with budgets and expected
verdicts; ADR 0015. The search stores its states by index with exact interned keys and keeps an engine copy only while
a state waits to be expanded: peak heap ÷9 over the twelve instances, ÷16 to ÷20 on the open ones, the time per state
unchanged (the engine's runs), verdicts and paths those of 4.1.8 state for state (a 203-search oracle, 909 corpus
games, 0 divergence). `--checkpoint`/`--resume`/`--mem` stop and take up a proof to the same verdict and witness, even
killed mid-expansion (the second reading found and fixed a budget cut that lost states); `--profile` attributes the
states to positions, inventories, flags, dialogues and scripts; `--symmetry` folds twin items (off by default, limits
in the ADR); `--workers` share the visited table with work stealing, the result independent of their number; `npm run
prove:matrix` runs nightly. Eight of twelve instances finish within budget, as with 4.1.8: the gap report names the
lever (a memo for macro moves and hand-overs, who carries which key). Left for later, said as such: that memo, the
symbolic spike (not tried), dominance in proofs, the runner's numbers (the nightly's), the new modules in the mutation
core set.

## v4.1.12 "Language" (shipped 7 October 2026): the game as data, its fingerprint, its objectives

The programme's fifth release. `compileIR` turns a compiled game into its logic as plain data (rooms, entities, rules,
scripts, objectives, Reality policies, the trusted extensions by name, a variant slot reserved for 4.1.15),
deterministic, with the `file:line` that writes each id; every field of a game, a room and an entity is classified
logic, presentation, both or tooling in one table the compiler checks (ADR 0013); the runtime keeps reading the
compiled game, the IR is a projection. The fingerprint is four SHA-256 computed with WebCrypto: `logic`,
`trustedExtensions` (the game's code, hashed by the build into `site.json`), `presentation`, `engine`; a rule changed
moves `logic` only, a decor `presentation` only. `canonicalJson` (NFC, sorted keys, no `-0`, big integers as decimal
strings, anything lossy refused) is one function for the fingerprint, the proof cache and, from 4.1.14, the speedrun
envelope, held to fifty edge values in Node; `npm run e2e:canonical` compares them in Chromium, WebKit and Firefox, written in this lot and not yet in CI. Objectives
(ADR 0014) are the one primitive admitted: `objectives` in a game, the pause menu's quest journal,
`objectiveCompleted` in the semantic journal once and never again, `npm run solve -- --goal=100%`, the validator's
refusals; every other candidate of the programme is refused with its proof in `docs/dev/DSL-STABILITY.md`. The Studio
generates its forms from the schemas and writes objectives with a previewed diff and Undo; MCP gains `get_ir`; the
DSL's reference (`docs/en/DSL.md`, fr) is generated from the schemas and held by a test. D22: the DSL and the IR are
stabilised here, frozen after Remix. Left for later, said as such: `e2e:canonical` in CI's rows, the Studio's demo
mode writing objectives, `IrVariantSlot` filled by 4.1.15.

## v4.1.11 "Viewport" (shipped 7 October 2026): the rendering behind a scene frame, the journal in the core

The programme's fourth release, the second with a release candidate (`v4.1.11-rc.1`, then `v4.1.11` on the same
commit). The semantic journal belongs to the core (`Engine.journal`, ADR 0011): a session started, a room entered, an
item acquired or lost, a flag changed, a character switched, an ending reached, a load, the autosave that follows,
numbered and emitted by the command handlers and the engine's lifecycle, never by the DOM; replaying a session yields
the same journal on the sample game, the reference chapter and 200 generated games, `npm run replay` compares it, a
session file carries it (a bounded window of 10 000 events, said as such when exceeded). The room view makes an
immutable `SceneFrame` with a pure function (camera, layers, characters, targets with their hit polygons, effects, a
hash) then paints it; every room of the two bundled games in three states paints the same DOM as before. `App`
composes a `Presenter` and a `Renderer`; a verb, a walk, a choice, a skip, a screen opened is an `Intent` (D21: the
rendering is not a source of state), and the same clicks on the DOM and on the Canvas painter record the same session
and journal at device pixel ratios 1, 2 and 3. The Canvas painter survives a lost context; the route between walk
zones is the core's. The Studio edits a room's layers, masks, zones and portals on the backdrop; the validator refuses
a mask that closes no surface and a zone no link joins. ADR 0012: Canvas 2D stays the complete backend, WebGL/Pixi not
measured in this lot. Left for later, said as such: every browser measure of this lot (`e2e:perf` on both painters,
CPU and memory budgets, a real phone), the WebGL spike, `objectiveCompleted` (4.1.12).

## v4.1.10 "Constellation" (shipped 7 October 2026): a durable Bridge, several instances, several tenants

The programme's third release, the first since 4.1.8 with a release candidate (`v4.1.10-rc.1`, then `v4.1.10` on the same
commit). The Bridge reads and writes through `RealityStore` (ADR 0009), every method taking the tenant first, one
transaction deciding deduplication, sequence, quotas and signature: SQLite through `node:sqlite` for one machine,
Postgres through `pg` for several instances (experimental until a real deployment), the 4.1.9 journal still served and
migrated by `npm run bridge -- migrate`. Instances keep no state of their own: a stream on one receives what another
accepted, woken by `NOTIFY` or a short poll; three processes with one killed during 1 000 proposals lose nothing
(tested). One server serves several tenants, routed by `Host`, each with its keys, root, quotas, rotation and
revocations; a threat model written first (`docs/dev/threat-models/constellation.md`) asked for a signal that names its
context, so `SignalV2` carries tenant, environment, origin, link and key (ADR 0010; the player accepts V1 and V2 until
4.1.12, a multi-tenant Bridge signs V2 only). Operations: `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/healthz`, OpenTelemetry metrics when
the API is installed, `tenant export|delete`, `backup`, `restore`, quarantine of rows that no longer verify, 503 with
`Retry-After` from a busy store, `--trust-proxy` by allowlist (D20). Measured: 1 008 proposals a second on three
SQLite instances locally (`docs/dev/BENCH-BRIDGE.md`). Left for later, said as such: the Postgres load figures (the
nightly's), retention on a SQL store, row-level security per tenant, a rate limit per connector shared between
instances; the human pass of a real multi-instance deployment behind HTTPS.

## v4.1.9 "Gateways" (shipped 7 October 2026): the world outside, through four connectors

The programme's second release, the same day as the first. A package `web-scumm-connectors` (the fourth tarball) with
one SDK (a connector receives, validates, binds to a player, carries a deduplication key, proposes with its own
attenuated Biscuit; at least once, applied once; the payload never leaves the connector, the Bridge gets its hash) and
four connectors, each with its threat model written before its code and its abuse tests: email (an HMAC webhook, or a
bounded IMAP client; MIME read in a worker under limits; HTML inert; attachments refused), Telnet (a virtual shell of
the game's declared commands, limits per address and per session), SSH (`ssh2`, a pairing code or a declared key, a
virtual terminal and disk, nothing of the host), Open Badges (OB2 and OB3 verified, revocation and status lists, every
fetch through an SSRF-safe fetcher). A game's build refuses server code; `games/signals` plays a chapter through an
email and a terminal, from recorded replays the solver proves. All four are `experimental` in SUPPORT until a real
provider, a real badge, a controlled exposure of SSH and Telnet have been tried by people. The cadence itself: the
CHANGELOG and the LOG as fragments per branch (`changes/`), the CI in three tiers sized by the change (`plan`,
`pr-gate`), the mutation job off the pull request path. Left for later, said as such: email replies, DKIM/SPF, IMAP
STARTTLS and IDLE; a coverage floor and a mutation gate for `connectors/`; the human passes.

## The 4.1.8 → 4.1.15 programme (decided 7 October 2026, D18): finish the breaks before the contracts freeze

No production game depends on web-scumm yet (the maintainer's own game stays on 3.1.0, D8): the saves, projects and
public API of the 4.1 line are oracles of behaviour, not a park to preserve at any cost. The programme uses that window
to finish the architecture breaks before 4.2 freezes the contracts. Its source is `docs/dev/PLAN-4.1.8-4.1.15.md`
(French, the decisions); `docs/dev/PROGRAM-4.1.md` summarises it in English; `docs/dev/plans/` holds one execution
sheet per release (what exists, the decisions, the contracts, the branches in order with their tests first, the gates). Rules of every version: a fixture or a test
that shows the need before the code; an ADR for every transversal contract; the core deterministic, the content
declarative; every primitive reaches the runtime, the validator, the solver, the replay, the Studio, the MCP and the
docs; never `proved`, `verified` or `delivered` when a budget was cut; bundle, memory, build, proof and coverage
measured against the previous version; the packed archives tested, not only the checkout; a human-pass sheet per
release (D12); the next version opens only when the current one's blockers are closed.

| Version | Working name | Expected result |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1.8 | **Foundation Reset** (shipped 7 October 2026) | TypeScript 7, Vite 8, PWA 2, the Reality cursor fixed (the port's local cursor moved before the acknowledgement: reproduced in polling), release checks that predict the release, a release candidate first |
| 4.1.9 | **Gateways** (shipped 7 October 2026) | email, SSH, Telnet and Open Badges connectors on one SDK, out of the player, experimental until a real pass |
| 4.1.10 | **Constellation** (shipped 7 October 2026) | a durable Bridge, replicated and isolated by tenant; the signal may become `SignalV2` if the threat analysis asks |
| 4.1.11 | **Viewport** (shipped 7 October 2026) | a renderer separate from the game logic, behind an immutable `SceneFrame`; a semantic journal owned by the core |
| 4.1.12 | **Language** (shipped 7 October 2026) | the DSL and an intermediate representation (`GameIR`, a game fingerprint) shaped by Gateways and Viewport; the core stabilised |
| 4.1.13 | **Solver Research** (shipped 7 October 2026; "Proof at Scale" not reached) | a documented class of open three-character games proved within published budgets, or named "Solver Research" |
| 4.1.14 | **Time Attack** (shipped 7 October 2026) | speedrun categories, RTA and logical time, semantic splits, a verifiable proof package, ghosts, LiveSplit and OBS as local tools |
| 4.1.15 | **Remix** (shipped 7 October 2026) | controlled variance of a game, deterministic by seed, with provable solvability; the DSL frozen after it |
| 4.2.0 | **Stable World** | the contracts frozen, the compiled package on npm, the human passes done, a first real reference game |

The order is meant: dependencies and integrity before connectors; connectors prove the Bridge before it is distributed;
the renderer before the staging primitives; the DSL stabilised before the solver is reinvested in; speedrun reuses the
replay, the solver and the Bridge once stable; Remix reuses its seeds, proofs and packages. Human passes stay reported,
not blocking, through 4.1.x (D12), and become blocking for 4.2.0 on every surface announced as supported.

## After 4.0: where each item went, and what is still unplanned

- The field passes, then what they find (D12); blocking for 4.2.0 (D18).
- Publishing `web-scumm` and `create-web-scumm` on npm: 4.2.0 "Stable World"; The Lighthouse in a public repository.
- Vite 8 and TypeScript 7 (declined in 4.0: Vite 8's bundler breaks a CommonJS default import, TypeScript 7 drops
  `baseUrl` and non-relative `paths`): 4.1.8 "Foundation Reset", with the project template's `tsconfig.json`.
- Translations loaded on demand (the second language is ~10% of the first visit's JavaScript): a change to the game
  module's contract, so a minor with a deprecation, not a patch.
- The open matrix of three characters: not reached in 4.1.13 "Solver Research" (8 of 12 within budget); the memo
  for macro moves and hand-overs the gap report names is the lever left.
- Lip-sync markers in the voice table (left from 3.4).

## Out of scope (explicit decisions)

- No Phaser, no general physics engine (D10). Canvas 2D is allowed from 3.4 as a second scene renderer, the DOM staying
  the reference until they agree; WebGL only for an effect Canvas 2D measurably cannot hold.
- No dialogue format parallel to the DSL.
- No npm package before 4.2.0 "Stable World" (D18; before it, no second person had asked for one).

## Verification (every milestone)

1. `npm run validate && npm run solve && npm test && npm run build` green, CI green, asset audit green.
2. The demo uses every new primitive at least once and the e2e goes through it (844 × 390 captures).
3. A save made with the previous version of the demo loads after migration (a unit test on a JSON frozen per milestone).
4. Copy of `src/engine` into the private game: its tests, solver and e2e unchanged.
5. MCP: `npm run -s mcp` lists the updated tools; a fresh AI session adds a script / event to the demo following only CONTENT_GUIDE.
6. Tagged release with notes; the README's "Releases" table updated.
