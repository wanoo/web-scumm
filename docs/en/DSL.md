# The DSL, generated from its schemas

A game is data (`docs/en/CONTENT_GUIDE.md` shows how to write one): conditions and commands inside rooms, rules,
topics, listeners and scripts, typed by `web-scumm/content`. This page is the reference of that vocabulary, generated
by `npx tsx tools/dsl-doc.ts` from the schemas the tools themselves read: the Studio's forms (`src/studio/schema.ts`),
the IR's schema (`src/engine/core/ir-schema.ts`) and the table that says what each field of a game counts as
(`src/engine/core/ir-fields.ts`). `tests/dsl-doc.test.ts` fails when the page is behind them, so what you read here is
what the validator, the solver and the Studio accept.

## Stability

Since 4.1.12 the names and meanings listed below are **stable** (D22): a change to one is a break that ships with its
migration of the bundled games and saves. What may still grow until 4.1.15, and what is frozen after it for 4.2, is
written in `docs/dev/DSL-STABILITY.md`, with the primitives proposed for this release and why each was admitted or
refused. A new primitive enters with a short decision record and reaches the runtime, the validator, the solver, the
replay, the Studio, MCP and this page (`tests/propagation.test.ts`).

## The game as the tools see it

`npm run ir` prints the game's intermediate representation: its logic as plain data, each id with the file and line
that writes it. The Studio's **Language** tab shows the same, and MCP's `get_ir` returns it. The game's fingerprint
hashes it (`logic`), with the trusted extensions, the presentation and the engine apart; the pause menu shows its
short form. See `docs/dev/adr/0013-game-ir-and-fingerprint.md`.

### Conditions

A condition is data: a string for a flag, an object for the rest, nested with `not`, `all`, `any`.

| Written | Means |
|---|---|
| `'flag'` | The flag is set (true, a number other than 0, a word). |
| `'!flag'` | The flag is false or was never set. |
| `{ has: 'item' }` | The player holds the item. |
| `{ flag: 'x', eq?: value, gte?: n, lt?: n }` | The flag's value equals, reaches or stays under a number. |
| `{ not: cond }` | The condition does not hold. |
| `{ all: [cond, …] }` | Every condition holds. |
| `{ any: [cond, …] }` | At least one condition holds. |
| `{ visited: 'room' }` | The room has been entered at least once. |
| `{ room: 'room' }` | The player is in this room. |
| `{ prop: ['room.prop', 'state'] }` | The prop is in that state. |
| `{ unlocked: 'place' }` | The place is unlocked on the map. |
| `{ seen: 'key' }` | The topic, choice or listener was already seen. |
| `{ actorIn: ['who', 'room'] }` | The character is in that room. |
| `{ player: 'who' }` | This character is the one the player controls. |

### Commands

A command is one key of `CMD_KEYS`; its fields are the Studio form’s. A plain string is the hero’s line.

| Command | Shape | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `say` | `{ say: [who, line], id?: id, shout?: true, voice?: id }` | A character says a line (a plain string is the hero). |
| `walk` | `{ walk: target \| [x, y], who?: who }` | A character walks to a thing or a point. |
| `face` | `{ face: target, who?: who }` | A character turns left, right or towards a thing. |
| `pose` | `{ pose: [who, pose] }` | A character takes a pose until told otherwise. |
| `anim` | `{ anim: [who, pose], ms?: number, at?: … }` | A character plays a pose once, with commands at chosen frames. |
| `place` | `{ place: [who, at], face?: 'left' \| 'right' }` | A character appears at a point, without walking. |
| `wait` | `{ wait: number }` | Waits that many milliseconds. |
| `parallel` | `{ parallel: [[cmd, …], …] }` | Runs several lists at the same time, until all end. |

| `done` | cond | Done the first time this condition holds after an action; best a condition that stays true. |
| `optional` | boolean (optional) | A side objective: not part of 100% (`npm run solve -- --goal=100%`). |
| `parent` | string (optional) | The objective this one is a step of: shown under it. |

### How each field counts (IR and fingerprint)

From `core/ir-fields.ts`: `logic` is in the IR and the fingerprint’s `logic`; `presentation` in its `presentation`; `both` splits; `meta` is for the tools only.

The game (`GameDef`):

- **logic**: `schemaVersion`, `id`, `saveVersion`, `hero`, `players`, `hintItem`, `hintVoice`, `rules`, `scripts`, `events`, `globalTalk`, `start`, `reality`, `checkpoints`, `invariants`, `migrations`, `objectives`
- **both**: `verbs`, `characters`, `items`, `rooms`, `map`
- **presentation**: `title`, `renderer`, `audio`, `skin`, `ending`, `saves`, `settings`, `ui`, `titleScreen`, `creditsScreen`, `credits`
- **meta**: `lang`, `offline`, `lint`, `i18n`, `assetBudgets`, `speedrun`

A room (`RoomDef`):

- **logic**: `id`, `name`, `hotspots`, `look`, `on`, `talk`, `hints`, `onEnter`, `scripts`, `events`, `hero`
- **both**: `props`, `actors`, `exits`, `stage`
- **presentation**: `decor`, `music`, `renderer`
- **meta**: `description`, `furniture`
