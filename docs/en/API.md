# Public API

Since 4.0 a game, a host page and a game's tests use four entry modules and the `web-scumm` command. Their names are
the contract: `tests/api-surface.json` lists them, `tests/api-surface.test.ts` fails when one changes without this
page, and `docs/en/SUPPORT.md` says how a change is made (announced, then removed at the next major). Everything else
under `src/engine` is internal and may change in any release; the `@engine/*` alias still reaches it, without that
promise.

In a game project the entries are `web-scumm/content`, `web-scumm/player`, `web-scumm/minigames` and
`web-scumm/testing` and, since 4.1.1, `web-scumm/reality` (the package's `exports`); in this repository the same names resolve to `src/engine/api/`.

## web-scumm/content: writing a game

## web-scumm/player: starting the game in a page

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `bootGame` | starts the game in the page (`BootOptions`: the game module, the root element, the service worker) |
| `BootOptions` · `SwModule` | its options, the service worker's registration module |
| `Locales` · `pickLanguage` | the translations a game ships, which one a visit gets |
| `openStore` · `StoreOpener` | the save store a page opens (IndexedDB, else localStorage), and how to supply another |
| `SaveStore` · `SlotStore` | the autosave store and the manual slots a host may provide |

| `SceneFrame` · `Renderer` · `Intent` | (4.1.11) an immutable picture of a room with its precomputed hit polygons, the contract of whatever draws one, and the intentions it answers with: the only thing a renderer sends back (D21) |

## web-scumm/minigames: minigames as plugins

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `Minigame` | the contract: `run(ctx)`, and what the validator reads (`required`, `textParams`, `bindings`) |
| `MinigameCtx` | what a minigame is given: its zone, images, sounds, parameters, labels, an abort signal |
| `minigames` | the built-in ones (pipes, stroke, pick, hide, runner, scratch, cables), each loaded when it starts |
| `MINIGAME_CSS` | their shared style |

A game adds its own in its module's `minigames` (same contract): that is the plugin format.

## web-scumm/testing: a game's own tests

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `Engine` | the engine without a page (its members marked `@internal` are read by the modules of `core/` since 4.1.0: not part of the contract). Since 4.1.4: `destroy()` ends it (loops stopped, waiters released, nothing called back); `onError(error, where)` hears a script that threw (stopped, `scripts[id].off`) or a custom command that changed more than it declared; `beforeSave(state)` shapes what the store writes, `onLoad.before/after` frame a load; `clock` is the only time it knows (`started`, the trace, a session's date) |
| `FakePresenter` · `MemoryStore` | a front end that answers by script, a save store in memory |
| `solve` · `SolveOptions` · `SolveResult` | the solver: a way to the end, softlocks with `prove` |
| `parseSave` · `saveEnvelope` · `SaveEnvelopeV3` | a save's envelope: write it, read it back (migrations applied) |
| `SaveEnvelopeV4` · `upgradeEnvelope` · `SaveWorldMismatch` · `savedWorld` | (4.1.15) the save envelope with its world, the v3 → v4 migration (the story world), the error that names the world a save belongs to, the world a raw save names |
| `worldVerdict` · `leaderboardKey` · `REMIX_CATEGORIES` · `RemixCategoryRules` · `SpeedrunSeedPolicy` · `WorldEvidence` · `seedCommitment` · `logicalKey` | (4.1.15, D26) a run's world checked against its category (Story, Fixed, Random, Mystery, Daily), the leaderboard it goes to, a Mystery commitment, the key a proof certificate is filed under |
| `SemanticEvent` · `SemanticJournal` | (4.1.11) `Engine.journal`: what happened in the game, in ids, numbered (rooms, items with the player who lost or acquired them, flags, `null` for a flag removed, a player switch, the ending, loads and saves), emitted by the core alone and the same on a replay |
| `RunClock` | (4.1.14, ADR 0016) `Engine.runClock`: RTA (`monotonicNow`, never an authority), `logicalSteps` and `logicalTime` (bigints, microticks): it observes the core, never writes the state |
| `verifyRun` · `VerifyContext` · `SpeedrunVerifyResult` · `SpeedrunVerdict` · `isRankable` | (4.1.14, ADR 0017) a `.wsrun` replayed against the approved game: one verdict, a code, a reason, the trust it grants; only `valid` ranks, `inconclusive` never does |
| `SpeedrunEnvelope` · `TrustLevel` | (4.1.14) a run's proof (chunks chained from H0, final state hash, final proof, bigints as decimal strings) and how far it is believed (`local` → `replay-valid` → `server-witnessed` → `moderator-verified`) |

## web-scumm/reality: signals from the world outside (4.1.1)

| Name | What |
|---|---|
| `verifySignal` · `SignalExpectation` · `VerifyResult` · `RefusalCode` | a signed signal checked before it is read: size, algorithm, key, signature, then game, player, manifest, expiry; a refusal has a code |
| `signSignal` · `importBridgeKey` · `BridgeKey` · `Keyring` | signing as a Bridge does (tests, simulators); a Bridge's public key and the set the player trusts |
| `WorldSignalV1` · `WorldSignalV1Schema` · `SignedWorldSignalV1` · `MAX_SIGNAL_CHARS` | the payload and its schema, the compact JWS that carries it, its size limit |
| `WorldSignalPort` | where signals come from: a Bridge's transport, the simulator, a game's own |
| `RealityClient` · `RealityClientOptions` | verify, apply, wait for the durable save, acknowledge |
| `httpPort` · `HttpPortOptions` | the transport to a Bridge: Server-Sent Events read with fetch, or a fetch by cursor |
| `SignalSimulator` · `Fault` · `SimulatedDelivery` | a Bridge in the browser for the Studio and the tests: delays, duplicates, order, bad signatures, expiry, cuts |
| `realityManifest` · `manifestHash` · `RealityManifest` | the signals a game declares, as the Bridge checks them, and the hash its configuration keeps |
| `verifyDayToken` · `verifyCommitment` · `revealMatches` · `DayToken` · `CommitToken` · `TokenResult` | (4.1.15, D26) the daily challenge's signed seed and a Mystery commitment, checked offline with the key of the game's manifest, and a reveal against its commitment |

## Beside the modules

- **Authoring schema**: `schemaVersion: 3` in `defineGame`; `web-scumm migrate` brings an older game to it.
- **Saves**: the envelope `web-scumm-save` schema 3; every save of the 3.x line loads in 4.x (`tests/save-v3.test.ts`
  keeps one per release).
- **Studio and MCP**: the tools of `npm run mcp` are described by their schemas (`docs/en/MCP.md`); their names and
  their required and optional arguments are in `tests/api-surface.json` (`mcp`): a tool removed or a required argument
  added is an API change like any other.
- **Command line**: `web-scumm <command>` and its options (`docs/en/PACKAGE.md`).

| `compileManifest` | `(manifest: VariationManifest, world: RemixWorld): CompiledManifest` | public | Compiles a manifest against the game's world: every reason it cannot produce a world is collected and thrown together (`RemixManifestError`) |

| `CoupledPair` | `interface { hint, answer }` | public | One coupled pair: the hint the player reads and the answer the content accepts, chosen together or not at all. |
| `CustomCommand` | `interface { effects, pure, run }` | extension | A command a game defines in code: its effects on the state as plain commands, and its browser-only `run`. |
| `CustomCommands` | `type CustomCommands = Record<string, CustomCommand>` | extension | A game's custom commands by name, as `games/<id>/index.ts` exports them. |
| `CustomContext` | `interface { game, state, room, args, ui, scene, … 1 more }` | extension | What a custom command's `run` receives: the game, its state, the room, the arguments, the presenter and the scene element. |
| `defineGame` | `(game: GameDef): GameDef` | public | Declares the full game. |

| `IrScript` | `interface { id, scope, trigger, while, loop, do, … 1 more }` | public | A sequence of commands that runs without a player's action: a world script, a room's arrival, the intro. |

| `loadVariant` | `(c: CompiledManifest, stored: WorldVariant): { variant: WorldVariant; stale: boolean; }` | public | A stored variant (a save's, a session's, a speedrun's) checked and kept as it is: its hash must match its content; it is never regenerated,  |
